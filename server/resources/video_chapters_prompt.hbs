Make video summary from text in it. Divide video in chapters. Each chapter has title, description, start and finish timecode in ms.
Output just JSON (nothing else). Output JSON should have the following format

{
    "chapters": [
        {
            "title": "chapter title",
            "description: "chapter description",
            "startTimeMs": int // chapter start time in ms
            "endTimeMs": int // chapter end time in ms
        }
    ]
}
